qsapi
=====

## How to run it

Make sure you have MongoDB installed. Create a database named `qsapi`.

```
(sudo) npm install express nodemon jasmine-node
npm install
nodemon app.js
```

## Run tests

```
jasmine-node ./tests
```

You may need to exit the command once the tests have passed (to be fixed).
